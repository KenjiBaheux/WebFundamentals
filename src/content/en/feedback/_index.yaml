          Making sure that your web apps and sites work across platforms and browsers is crucial,
          one of the corner stones of the web and key to reaching and serving all your users.
          Therefore, we want to give you options both for reporting bugs and inconsistencies as
          well as help when you are building something.

    - heading: Cross-browser testing
      description: >
        We strongly recommend that you test in multiple web browsers
        on multiple platforms. Preferably on real machines and devices,
        but another option for doing that is using BrowserStack.

        When filing bugs, the more information the better, and if you have
        a reproducable test with a limited scope there's a much bigger chance
        your bug will be solved.

        If you encounter issues, inconsistencies, regressions
        or interoperability problems, contributing to existing
        bugs or report new ones helps a lot in making the web
        platform better and more predictable for developers.
